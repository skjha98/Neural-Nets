# Neural Networks

## Understanding in basics of Neural Netwroks with TensorFlow v2.0 --alpha

### First Commit: 
I have shown, how to mimic a linear function using Neural network just by giving hand-fulls of inputs for training.
Also, I have have shows, how the weights and bias changes with respect to the change in the neural networks in different to different cases.
